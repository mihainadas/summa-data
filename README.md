# Project Summa: Data Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the Project Summa: Data Repository. This repository is an integral component of Project Summa, a research initiative focused on advancing the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through the exploration and application of Large Language Models (LLMs).

The repository serves as a dedicated archive for the data essential to our research endeavors. It is meticulously curated to support the rigorous demands of academic research in NLP and to foster the development of innovative LLM applications.

### Repository Contents
- **Corpora for `summa`:** This collection comprises a diverse array of datasets, meticulously curated to facilitate the research and development activities of the `summa` repository. These corpora are instrumental in training and evaluating our LLMs, providing a robust foundation for empirical studies.
- **Database Backups:** The repository includes reliable backups of `galandriel-db` and `metabase-db`. These backups ensure the preservation of data integrity and the continuity of our research endeavors, allowing for reproducibility and verification of research outcomes.
